# Teamweek

Our aim is to provide an alternative to _status update_ meetings inspired by
[Google Snippets](http://blog.idonethis.com/google-snippets-internal-tool/).
Every week your team gets asked a couple of simple questions:

 * What have you achieved this week?
 * What do you commit to do next week?

The team replies and those get stored in a database that is searchable by any
team member, providing a more transparent way of communicating progress.
Using hashtags you can filter for the most recent updates for those projects
you're interested in, or you can search for a team member updates.

## Implementation

The initial implementation is done as a [Slack](https://slack.com/) bot that
interacts with your team members.
